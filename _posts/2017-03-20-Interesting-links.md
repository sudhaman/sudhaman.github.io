# Agriculture <a name="Agriculture" />
## Aquaponics <a name="Aquaponics" />
### Good fish suitable for aquaponics <a name="Good_fish_aquaponics" />
Below are the list of fish suitable for aquaponics
1. Koi - can feed them almost anything
2. Cat fish - can feed them anything (prefer low protein food) but make sure that you turn off lights in the night. They are active in the night.
3. Goldfish - can feed anything. Have been domesticated for a long peridos of time. Also, this fish can share the tank along side [Apple Snail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampullariidae).
4. Carp - More like Koi. Koi is a inbred carp.
5. Tilapia - Make sure that a few generations of Tilapia fish are not used for eating/sale as they may have parasites due to the [bad fish feed](http://www.eatthis.com/tilapia-is-worse-than-bacon) being fed to these fish in commercial tilapia grow centers.
### Compost tea with aquaponics <a name="Compost_tea_aquaponics" />
Though ocompost tea does not help in iron deficiency in the first few days, it will help in a aged system with lower PH. The video does not show how this compost tea is applied. One method to apply the compost tea is by spraying the compost tea on the plants of a aquaponics system. Also, using compost tea from a worm based compost is far better than the normal composting procedure as the risk of diseases is almost zero in the worm based compost.

### Goldfish or Koi <a name="Goldfish_Koi" />
#### Food for Goldfish <a name="Food_for_goldfish" />
##### Spinach for the Goldfish

##### Preparing the spinach for the Gold fish

#### Vegetables for the Goldfish <a name="Goldfish_veggies" />
Below are the list of fruits and vegetables the Gold fish feeds on.
1. Peas - helps at digestion
2. Lettuce
3. Spinach
4. Zucchini
5. Carrots
6. Cucumbers
7. Apples
8. Grapes
9. Garlic
10. Pieces of Orange (for vitamin C)
11. Rice
12. Broccoli
13. Corn
14. Beans

Other notable homemade plants
1. [Duckweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemnoideae) - Can also be used to filter water before it goes to the aquaponics system. It has also been used to filter heavy metals and this gives a general idea that water can be passed through a few layers of duckweed before it goes to acquarium and the first batch which contains most of the heavy metals can be passed to a biogas generator.

Remember to cook and chop all hard vegetables

# Competitive Programming <a name="CP"/>
## USACO <a name="USACO" />
A very nice website that teaches you how to code and prepares you for a Computing Olypiad. Link [here](http://www.usaco.org/).
## Google Code Jam <a name="Code_jam"/>
Old problems from the google code jam are a good place to [start](https://code.google.com/codejam/).
## Al Zimmermann's Programming contests <a name="AlZimmermann"/>
A little hard problems. Takes more time but then the solution also needs to be cleaner and so more effort and better clarity on problems.  
Link [here](http://azspcs.com).
## UVa Online judge <a name="UVA" />
Link [here](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/).

How somethings we take for granted are affecting the world!  
## Are resources always good ?<a name="natural_exploitation">
### Exploitation of workers in Nigeria over oil!  

We take oil as a commodity that is being used commonly for everything - commute, power generation(yes, it is replacing coal as of today - 2018), etc.

### Exploitation of tin in Indonesia

Tin is used in all electronic goods. Yet we never ask where did it come from ?

### Underwater gold mines in Philippines  
  
The lack of money in Philippine combined with the hope that a living can be earned out of mining gold illegaly takes toll on lives and the living conditions of the people.

### Textile industries polluting rivers in Indonesia  
  
The waste from the textile industry in Indonesia is polluting the Citarum river. Lack of sanitation facilities is making the conditions worse due to defecation in the river. The locals also dump the waste in the river making it very polluted. The people of the region use this river for swimming, bathing, drinking and washing dishes!!
